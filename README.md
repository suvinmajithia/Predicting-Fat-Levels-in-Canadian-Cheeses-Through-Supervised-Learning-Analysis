# Predicting-Fat-Levels-in-Canadian-Cheeses-Through-Supervised-Learning-Analysis
The data was obtained from Kaggle and follows an Open Government Licence (Canada). I am using 'cheese.csv'  dataset for my final Machine Learning project.  My goal for the project is to use classification to predict the different cheese fat levels based on various features.

This project was completed as part of the final Machine Learning assignment for the KCDS course at the University of British Columbia.

The dataset (cheese.csv) was obtained from Kaggle and follows the Open Government Licence (Canada). It contains over 1,200 entries describing various types of Canadian cheese, including features such as moisture, protein, and fat content.

The goal of this project was to apply classification techniques to predict the fat level (Low, Medium, High) of different cheese samples based on their nutritional attributes. I also explored anomaly detection as an extension of the classification task.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. Use supervised learning models to classify cheese fat levels
2. Apply feature engineering and preprocessing to improve model performance
3. Evaluate models using metrics such as F1-score and ROC-AUC
4. Investigate model reliability and anomaly detection for edge cases

ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier
ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix, F1-Score
Feature Engineering & Normalization
Jupyter Notebook for analysis


ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways
1. Feature scaling and selection significantly impacted model accuracy.
2. SVM performed best among the models tested, especially for medium-fat classification.
3. Real-time anomaly detection methods helped flag data inconsistencies or edge-case predictions.
