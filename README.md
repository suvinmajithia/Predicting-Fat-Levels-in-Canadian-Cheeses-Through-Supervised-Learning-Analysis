# Predicting-Fat-Levels-in-Canadian-Cheeses-Through-Supervised-Learning-Analysis
The data was obtained from Kaggle and follows an Open Government Licence (Canada). I am using 'cheese.csv'  dataset for my final Machine Learning project.  My goal for the project is to use classification to predict the different cheese fat levels based on various features.
